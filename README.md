# NASA Experiment Duct Geometry

Duct geometry from NACA TN D-995 (Hover)

This repo contains the duct & propeller geometry that we make use of in our experiments in the paper "[Kriging assisted integrated rotor-duct optimization for ducted fan in hover](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2019-0007)."

More specifically: 
- `-ASB_NACA_Duct_Only-.SLDPRT` # Maybe some explanation
- `-ASB_NACA_Duct_Only-.IGS` # Maybe some explanation
