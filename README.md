# NASA Experiment Duct Geometry

Duct geometry from NACA TN D-995 (Hover)

This repo contains the duct & propeller geometry that we make use of in our experiments in the paper "Kriging assisted integrated rotor-duct optimization for ducted fan in hover."

More specifically:

-ASB_NACA_Duct_Only-.SLDPRT       # The original Solidworks model which represents 1/3 of of the ducted fan. 
-ASB_NACA_Duct_Only-.IGS          # The IGES model for general file exchange
